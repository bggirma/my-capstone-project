  <p>Okay, so here’s the deal – I’m really hoping to get my first full-stack developer job and yeah I’m pretty much begging you to take a chance on me! I promise I’m eager passionate and ready to jump in with both feet. Sure, I may not have decades of experience, but I’m super excited to learn grow and show you what I’ve got. So... how about it? Take a chance on a newbie like me?
